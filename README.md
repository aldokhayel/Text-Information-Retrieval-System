# Text Information Retrieval System

Information retrieval is the process of extracting useful information from data. In the current era, text constitutes an important form of data. This includes web pages, emails, SMS messages and several other text documents types.

Text documents need to be represented in an appropriate format (usually in the form of vectors of numbers) in order to be used for further processing. Once properly repre- sented, text documents can be used for various tasks such as classification, for instance, deciding whether an email is a spam, or search, for example, deciding whether two web pages have similar content.
